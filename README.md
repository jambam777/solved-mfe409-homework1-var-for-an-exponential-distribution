VaR for an exponential distribution

<ol>

 <li>Assume an asset value in 10 days follows an exponential distribution withmean <em>W</em><sub>0</sub>. Derive a formula for the value-at-risk for confidence <em>c </em>and reference level <em>W</em><sub>0 </sub>for the asset. Apply with <em>W</em><sub>0 </sub>= 100 and <em>c </em>= 99%.</li>

 <li>Now assume you are short this asset. Compute your value-at-risk for confidence <em>c </em>and apply with the same numerical values.</li>

 <li>Comment on the similarity or difference between the results in the twoquestions.</li>

 <li>Repeat the previous questions with expected shortfall.</li>

</ol>

<h2>2        VaR for mixtures</h2>

You have to allocate $1bn in the stock market. You are discussing with your partner regarding the volatility of returns. She has a view that, in line with historical averages, the volatility of returns will be of <em>σ</em><sub>1</sub>=10% in the next year. However, you believe that volatility will be higher, in the orders of <em>σ</em><sub>2</sub>=15% for the next year. After discussing with your partner, you agree in the following way: stocks returns follow a normal distribution with mean <em>µ </em>and <em>σ</em><sub>1 </sub>with probability <em>π </em>and normal distribution with mean <em>µ </em>and <em>σ</em><sub>2 </sub>with probability 1 − <em>π </em>. For now assume that <em>µ </em>= 7% and <em>π </em>= 0<em>.</em>6.

<ol>

 <li>Compute the 1-year 99% VaR with your view, with your partner view,and with the common view. Compare results and provide a very brief explanation as if you were presenting to your manager.</li>

<ol start="2">

 <li>To understand the role of <em>π</em>, plot a chart with <em>π </em>between 0 and 1 on the horizontal axiswhich and the corresponding VaR on the vertical axis. Comment on your results.</li>

 <li><em>More challenging. </em>After presenting your common view to your manager, you are challenged with an alternative view about volatility: <em>σ </em>is timevarying. The volatility trader suggests that a sensible model for sigma is a gamma distribution. Explain in as many details as possible (either derive of formula or use a computer program) how to compute the VaR of your portfolio when returns have a normal distribution conditional on <em>σ </em>and <em>σ </em>is distributed according to a Gamma distribution.</li>
